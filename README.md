### About me;
  <br> I'm Ruan Ottawa, Canada, and I am a front end developer and designer. I enjoy learning new things (languages and frameworks) i also like ui, ux. you may have the best service (in term of a website of app) posible but if you have a bad ui/ux you may not get any client because of the bad UI and UX that the client see when using your site or app.
