### About me;
  <br> I'm Ruan from Ottawa, Canada, and I am a front-end developer and designer (aspiring fullstack developer). I enjoy learning new things (languages and frameworks) I also like ui, ux.  
You may have the best service (in terms of websites or apps) posible but if you have a bad ui/ux you may not get any client/users because of the bad UI and UX that the client see when using your site or app. Take myspace for example -*sarcasm*- 😂😂.📳
